# Hello Friend

Hello Friend is a multi-page web application developed with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) javascript frameworks for the Nextech 2020 Summer Coding Competition

## Features

The features that were included were the use of an anonymous journal, where the users responses were instantly deleted as a way to show progress or letting go of a journaled issue, along with a support page showing how users affected by mental disorders can recieve help

## Installation

### Requirements

The Node.js framework is required, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Node, or download it from their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
brew install node
```

From there, clone the Hello Friend repository found [here](https://github.com/collinpfeifer/hellofriend) on GitHub

and navigate to the directory  

```bash
cd Where/The/Directory/Lives

```

An example:

```bash
cd Users/User/Downloads/hellofriend
```

Once inside the directory run the server start command

```bash
npm start
```

and it now should open a window in your preferred internet browser where the web application is viewable

## Support

If there are any found issues or potential changes, please contact me at collinpfeifer@gmail.com.

## Roadmap

Later on down the road I plan to add other features such as a chat room, a plug-in for Google calender, a section for advice, an FAQ and other smaller tweaks to keep the user experience at a high

## Contributions

At the moment, I would like to keep this project free from contributions as I still have quite a few ideas about where I could take it, but afterward I am more than welcome to have contributions, big or small
